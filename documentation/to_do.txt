Potential and Past Issues:

ADDING A PHYSICS MATERIAL CAUSED THE SIMULATION TO EXPLODE AFTER ABOUT 1000 ITERATIONS!!!
I added a physics material to the LeftCalf and RightCalf, set the static and dynamic coefficients of friction to 100, and the density to PETG.
This caused the simulation to explode after about 1000 iterations, or at least I am 95% sure this was the cause. It no longer happens anymore thank god.

THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH sudo prime-select on-demand !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To Do:

- Video:
    - Start capturing screen video of failures in Isaac Sim as well as shots of code and resulting errors in Isaac Lab.
    - Create a google doc where I can document the flow of my development process so that I don't forget the challenges I faced.

- Design Harold R2:
    - Spherical feet.
    - Switch to robstride actuators.

- Set physics parameters:
    - Friction coefficient.
    - Coefficient of restitution to 0.

- Log various parameters to tensorboard.

- Add in missing reward terms.

- Add noise to observation terms:
    - Orientation.
    - Angular velocities.
    - Joint positions.
    - Joint velocities.
    - Linear velocities.
    - Foot positions.

- Add non-zero angular velocity commands into the training regimen.
    - Modify the heuristic step trajectories by adding and subtracting from L and R velocities according to circles of arc.

- Domain Randomization:
    - Randomize a number of properties.
    - Consider adding domain randomization to the actuator gains instead of joint friction coefficient.
    - Add the option to add a push speed as part of the training curriculum.

- Estimator network:
    - Collect a dataset of inputs to the estimator network, as well as linear velocities and contact states using the recorder manager.
    - Train an estimator network in a similar manner to that used in the BRAVER paper.
