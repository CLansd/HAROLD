Potential and Past Issues:

ADDING A PHYSICS MATERIAL CAUSED THE SIMULATION TO EXPLODE AFTER ABOUT 1000 ITERATIONS!!!
I added a physics material to the LeftCalf and RightCalf, set the static and dynamic coefficients of friction to 100, and the density to PETG.
This caused the simulation to explode after about 1000 iterations, or at least I am 95% sure this was the cause. It no longer happens anymore thank god.

THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH sudo prime-select on-demand !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To Do:

- Video:
    - Start capturing screen video of failures in Isaac Sim as well as shots of code and resulting errors in Isaac Lab.
    - Create a google doc where I can document the flow of my development process so that I don't forget the challenges I faced.

- Design Harold R2:
    - Spherical feet.
    - Switch to robstride actuators.

- Set physics parameters:
    - Friction coefficient.
    - Coefficient of restitution to 0.

- Log various parameters to tensorboard.

- Add in missing reward terms.

- Add noise to observation terms:
    - Orientation.
    - Angular velocities.
    - Joint positions.
    - Joint velocities.
    - Linear velocities.
    - Foot positions.

- Add non-zero angular velocity commands into the training regimen.
    - Modify the heuristic step trajectories by adding and subtracting from L and R velocities according to circles of arc.

- Domain Randomization:
    - Randomize a number of properties.
    - Consider adding domain randomization to the actuator gains instead of joint friction coefficient.
    - Add the option to add a push speed as part of the training curriculum.

- Estimator network:
    - Get rid of the estimator network.

LimX:
- Wei Zhang, co-founder of LimX dynamics and professor at SUSTech in Shenzhen.
    - He was a prof in the US so should understand English well.

- Changed solver_velocity_iteration_count in harold.py from 0 to 4 to match the value used in the Tron 1 repo.
    - Tested as having negligible effect on simulation time.
- Changed actuator damping in harold_cfg.py from 0.45 to 0.9 to closer reflect the stiffness to damping ratio used in the Tron 1 repo.
- Split the velocity command generator's resampling period into two variables (from one): vel_resamp_min=0.0, vel_resamp_max-5.0.
    - Changed from a range of (10.0,10.0) as previous.
    - Changed to match the values in the LimX repo.
- Increased the x and y linear velocity and z angular velocity command ranges from (0.0,0.0) to (-0.5,0.5), to be half of LimX repo values.
- Copied gait_command.py file from LimX repo.
- Copied UniformGaitCommandCfg from LimX repo into new file commands.py, part of mdp folder.
- Modified mdp's __init__.py to import commands.py file.
- Deleted gait_period and gait_height variables from harold_cfg.py
- Added gait_resampling_period=5.0, gait_freq_min=1.5, gait_freq_max=2.5, gait_phase_offs_min=0.5, gait_phase_offs_max=0.5, gait_durations_min=0.5, gait_durations_max=0.5, gait_swing_height_min=0.1, and gait_swing_height_max=0.2 to harold_cfg.py.
- Added gait_command to commands in harold_env_cfg.py
- Deleted reference_foot_positions, actual_feet_positions, phase_tensor, and contact_probabilities from observations in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Added gait_command to observations in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Deleted phase_tensor(), stance_phase_pos(), swing_phase_pos(), reference_feet_positions(), and feet_pos_in_root_frame() from observations.py.
- Copied get_gait_command() from LimX repo and added into observations.py.
- Deleted calc_phi_i(), feet_speed_rew(), feet_contact_during_swing_rew(), and feet_position_tracking_l2 from rewards.py.
- Deleted feet_position_tracking_l2 from Rewards in harold_env_cfg.py.
- Code runs without errors at this point.
